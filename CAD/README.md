## Parts and Assemblies
All the CADs for the hexapod are in this directory. Except the body and the overall assembly, the other parts can be found in the Leg and the External folder. All the homemade components are in the main folder and inside the [Leg](./Leg) folder. The files found online are in the [External Resources](./External) folder. The [Printing and Cutting](./Print_Cut) folder contain all the files necessary to print or cut our pieces.

The hexapod was design with only a coxa motor and a tibia motor, omitting the femur motor to minimise the power requirements. Most motion types should be feasible, albeit a little more limited. Legs on each side of the body are designed symmetrically to align the feet and facilitate the body design (mirrored sketches). They each contain a foot, two motors, two bearings and their mounts, a joint and its two attachments, and some screws and bolts. The hexapod assembly contains six legs, three of which are mirrored, an on-board computer, a microcontroller board, a voltage regulator, a PWM servo driver, a battery, and some fasteners.
