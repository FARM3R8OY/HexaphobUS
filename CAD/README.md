The hexapod was designed with only a coxa motor and a tibia motor, omitting the femur motor to minimise the power requirement. Most motion types should be feasible, albeit a little more limited. Legs on each side of the body are designed symmetrically to align the feet and facilitate the body design (mirrored sketches). They each contain a foot, two motors, two bearings and their mounts, a joint and its two attachments, and some screws and bolts. The hexapod assembly contains six legs, three of which are mirrored, an on-board computer, a microcontroller board, a voltage regulator, a PWM servo driver, a battery, and some fasteners.
